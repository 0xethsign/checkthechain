The `ctc` command line interface can perform many different tasks related to data collection, data analysis, and general block exploration.

Calls to `ctc` follow the general format `ctc <subcommands> [options]`.

When `pip` installs the `ctc` python package, it also installs the `ctc` cli program. If your environment does not include installed python scripts in your shell's `PATH`, then you may need to type `python3 -m ctc ...` in the terminal instead of just `ctc ...`.


## Subcommands

All `ctc` subcommands can be printed using `ctc -h`

Each cli subcommand has a variety of options to customize its output. If you need more customization than these options provide, then you should use `ctc` from a python script instead.
